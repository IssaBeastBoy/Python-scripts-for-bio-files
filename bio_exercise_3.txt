Question 1: CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF BOVINE HSC70(AA1-554)E213A/D214A MUTANT (1yuw)

Read in the file '1yuw.pdb' and study the format of the file. For more information, go to http://www.wwpdb.org/documentation/file-format-content/format33/v3.3.html

a) Basic information

The COMPND record describes the macromolecular contents of an entry. Your goal is to read in this information and store the following: 
	The Mol_id
	The name of this molecule
	The chain(s) associated with this molecule
	The synonyms for this molecule.
	
You will not do anything with this information for now, but store it in such a way that you could query any of this information, based on the Mol_id.
	
b) SeqRes records

Go to the SEQRES section of the file. This contains the amino acid sequence of the protein in this file, 
where each residue is given with its three-letter code.

Your goal is to extract these amino acids from the file and store them in a suitable data structure.
You must then write code to convert the sequence from this 'three-letter code' format to the 'one-letter code' 
format seen for sequences in FASTA format


c) Compare SeqRes to sequence

Compare the sequence extracted in (b) to the sequence given in the file '1yuw.fa'. Are there any differences? 


d) Extracting coordinate information

Extract all ATOM records for chain A of this file, including the TER record for chain A.





Question 2: THE CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF HUMAN DEOXYHAEMOGLOBIN AT 1.74 ANGSTROMS (4hhb)


Repeat the steps from Question 1. The challenge is to do this for each chain in the structure.
