Bio Exercise 1:

QUESTION 1:

Input file:
organism_1.fasta

Write a program that achieves the following

1) Read in the file 'organism_1.fasta'
2) Use 2 variables to store the following information:
	header: containing the header line (the line that starts with the '>' character)
	sequence: containing the sequence (consisting of letters "A", "T", "C" and "G" in this case)
		Note, your sequence should be one string, with all whitespace characters removed

3) Generate a report file called 'report_1.txt' with the following information:
	The description of the organism (from the header)
	The length of the sequence
	The frequency of each nucleotide base in the sequence


QUESTION 2:

Input files:
organism_1.fasta
organism_2.fasta

Write a program that goes through all the steps in Question 1 and generates a report file called 'report_2.txt'
This file must be have information from both files, organism_1.fasta and organism_2.fasta



QUESTION 3:

Input file: 
hsp70_multi.fa

Write a program that reads the file, 'hsp70_multi.fa'
For each FASTA entry, the program must keep track of the entry's header and sequence
Your program must simply print out the each sequence's header, along with the length of the sequence
