Bio Exercise 2:

QUESTION 1:

Input file:	sequences.fa

Write a program that reads in the file 'sequences.fa'. 
Your program should then report the header and sequence length of the 3 Longest sequences in the file and
	the 3 shortest sequences in the file.


QUESTION 2:

Input file: sequences.fa
Output file: sequence_60.fa

Write a program that reads in the file 'sequences.fa'. 
Your program must then create a new file called 'sequence_60.fa', containing all entries reade from 'sequences.fa'.

The only difference is that the sequences in this file must not span over more than 60 characters per line. 
	i.e. if a sequence is 135 characters in lenth, the sequence must be displayed over 3 lines.
		-> one line of the first 60 characters
		-> one line of the next 60 characters
		-> one final line of 15 characters

This should be done for each sequence in the file.




QUESTION 3:

Input file: alignment_Hsp70.txt
Output_file: alignment_Hsp70.fa

You are provided with the file 'alignment_Hsp70.txt', which contains an alignment of sequences in Clustal format.
Your goal is to write a program that reads in the file 'alignment_Hsp70.txt' and writes out a new file 'alignment_Hsp70.fa'.
This new file should contain the same aligned sequences in FASTA format. 
Note, the file should contain the same sequences as the Clustal format file.




QUESTION 4:

Input file: alignment_Hsp70.txt
Output_file: Hsp70s.fa

Write a program that reads in the file 'alignment_Hsp70.txt' and writes out a new file 'Hsp70s.fa'.
This new file should contain all sequences from the Clustal format file, converted to FASTA format.
The sequences in this file should Not be aligned and should not contain any gap ('-') characters.
