You are provided with the following: 


PfHsp70-x_nt.fa
---------------
The genomic sequence of the Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) 70 kDa heat shock 
protein x (PfHsp70-x), in FASTA format. *Note: This gene contains no introns.

Pf3D7_08_v3_nt.fa
-----------------
The nucleotide sequence of the entire chromasome Pf3D7_08 of P. falciparum. in FASTA format

translate.txt
-------------
A comma-delimited text file containing codons and the one-letter code of the amino acid they code for.
 -> 64 codons using the standard codon table.
 -> '*' character represents a STOP codon
 -> Assume 'M' is both the amino acid "Methionine", as well as a START codon
 
 
 
Question 1
----------

Read in the sequences from both 'PfHsp70-x_nt.fa' and 'Pf3D7_08_v3_nt.fa' as 'hsp70_seq' and 'gen_seq', respectively.
The gene for PfHsp70-x is found on chromasome Pf3D7_08.

    a) Can you confirm this using Python? If so, write code to do this.
    b) If not, why not?
    c) Use your answer from (b) to solve (a)
    
    d) Use Python code to determine the starting and ending position of the PfHsp70-x gene within the chromasome Pf3D7_08

Question 2
----------

Assuming gen_seq contains no introns, determine the total number of coding sequences that can found within chromasome Pf3D7_08



Question 3
----------
Using 'translate.txt' to help you, translate hsp70_seq from its nucleotide sequence to amino acid sequence.
Does this sequence match predicted protein sequence for PfHsp70-x?
    -> Again, confirm your answer at http://plasmodb.org/plasmo/app/record/gene/PF3D7_0831700
